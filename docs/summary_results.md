### Part 1: Descriptive Statistics

**1.1. Overall Prevalence of Specific CAM Types**

Analysis of the European Social Survey (ESS Round 11) reveals a broad spectrum of utilization across different Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) modalities. Physiotherapy is the most widely used practice, reported by 18.1% of the adult population in the past 12 months . This is followed by therapeutic massage (10.5%) and osteopathy (6.9%) onversely, practices such as acupressure and hypnotherapy show the lowest penetration rates, each utilized by only 0.6% of the population

**1.2. Cross-Country Variations in Europe**

CAM usage is highly heterogeneous across European countries . The highest prevalences are concentrated in Western and Northern Europe, led by Iceland (54.5%), Switzerland (54.4%), and France (50.6%) n stark contrast, Southern and Eastern European countries report significantly lower utilization rates, particularly in Greece (12.7%), Hungary (12.9%), and Italy (18.2%)

**1.3. Overlap Between Conventional and Alternative Care**
To better understand healthcare navigation, the sample was divided into four mutually exclusive groups depending on their combined use of conventional medical visits (General Practitioner or Specialist) and CAM over the past 12 months.

- Almost half of the respondents (49.0%) rely exclusively on **conventional medicine** .
- Nearly a third (31.6%) use **both conventional and alternative therapies**, representing the vast majority of CAM users .
- Exclusive use of **CAM only** is marginal, concerning just 3.0% of the population .
- Finally, 16.4% reported using **neither** conventional nor alternative care .

**1.4. Health Outcomes by Typology of Care**
Following the descriptive distribution, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests were conducted to investigate the association between the four-level care typology (Neither, Conventional only, CAM only, Both) and essential health indicators. The test results indicate highly significant global differences (p < 0.001) across the groups regarding subjective general health, physical limitations (hampered in daily activities), and levels of depressive symptoms (based on the prorated CES-D score).
